# Data Security and Governance in FinTech  
*MSc FinTech & Policy Dissertation | University of Surrey*  

This dissertation explores the **data governance and cybersecurity challenges** in the rapidly evolving FinTech sector.  
It critically evaluates how firms can balance **innovation, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust** under frameworks such as **GDPR, DORA, ISO/IEC 27001, and NIST CSF 2.0**.

## Abstract
Financial technology (FinTech) has transformed global financial systems by leveraging AI, cloud computing, and open banking.  
However, this innovation introduces serious **data governance, cybersecurity, and ethical risks**.  

This research develops an **integrated governance model** linking external regulatory drivers, internal control mechanisms, and security outcomes — benchmarked across major UK FinTechs (Monzo, Revolut, Starling, Zopa) and incumbents (Barclays, HSBC).  

**Key findings highlight:**
- Weaknesses in third-party and vendor risk management  
- Gaps in algorithmic governance and AI accountability  
- Regulatory complexity across GDPR, DORA, and FCA regimes  
- The role of RegTech in improving compliance and resilience  

---

## Objectives
1. Evaluate data governance and security practices in FinTech ecosystems.  
2. Compare UK, EU, and global regulatory standards.  
3. Develop a conceptual governance and resilience framework.  
4. Benchmark FinTech and bank practices against ISO 27001 & NIST CSF 2.0.  
5. Provide actionable recommendations for boards, regulators, and consumers.

## Methodology
- **Approach:** Desk-based mixed methods  
- **Techniques:** Thematic analysis, benchmarking, and comparative regulatory review  
- **Frameworks:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 • NIST CSF 2.0 (2024) • GDPR (2018) • DORA (2022) • FCA Consumer Duty (2023)  
- **Cases Studied:** Monzo • Revolut • Starling • Zopa • Barclays • HSBC

## Key Findings
| Theme | Insights |
|-------|-----------|
| Governance Maturity | FinTechs show agility but weak board-level governance. |
| Third-Party Risk | Cloud vendor dependence creates systemic risk exposure. |
| Algorithmic Governance | Limited oversight of AI bias and transparency. |
| Cyber Resilience | Quick detection, but poor recovery and testing readiness. |
| Regulatory Compliance | Reactive alignment vs. proactive compliance cultures. |

---

## Theoretical Frameworks
- **Dynamic Capabilities Theory (Teece, 2007)** – Agility vs. structural maturity  
- **Institutional Theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983)** – Regulatory conformity  
- **Socio-Technical Systems Theory (Trist, 1981)** – Human-technical alignment

## Recommendations

### For FinTech Firms
- Adopt *privacy-by-design* and governance-by-default practices.  
- Strengthen third-party and cloud monitoring with continuous auditing.  
- Establish AI ethics committees and algorithmic accountability reporting.  

### For Incumbent Banks
- Collaborate with FinTechs via regulatory sandboxes.  
- Leverage RegTech partnerships to modernize compliance infrastructure.  

### For Regulators
- Harmonize global resilience standards (GDPR, DORA, FCA).  
- Promote proportional regulation for smaller FinTechs.  

### For Consumers
- Enhance financial literacy around consent and data rights.  
- Encourage MFA and data management best practices.

## Academic & Practical Contributions
- Extends **data governance maturity theory** to the FinTech domain.  
- Provides an integrated framework aligning cybersecurity, regulation, and ethics.  
- Offers **policy-level recommendations** to strengthen trust and resilience.
